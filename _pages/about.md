Dr. Wenbo Ding is now an associate professor and leading the smart sensing and robotics (SSR) group in Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University. He received the B.E and Ph.D. degrees (both with the highest honors) from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011 and 2016, respectively, and then worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, under the supervision of Professor Z. L. Wang from 2016 to 2019. He has published over 70 journal and conference papers and received many prestigious awards, including the National Early-Career Award, the IEEE Scott Helt Memorial Award for the best paper published in IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting, the 2019 Natural Science Award (Second Prize) from Institute of Electronics, the Gold Medal and Special Prize at the 47th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, the Tsinghua Top Grade Scholarship (highest student honor in Tsinghua), the Tsinghua Lin Feng Counsellor Prize (highest student mentor honor in Tsinghua). His research interests are diverse and interdisciplinary, which include self-powered sensors, energy harvesting, wearable devices for health and soft robotics with the help of signal processing, machine learning and mobile computing.
